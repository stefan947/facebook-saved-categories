# facebook-saved-categories
Hello, I can't coding. I am learning python now but it is not so easy. 

So I would like to create a tool with which it should be possible everytime I save a post on facebook to add this post to a specific category.
This category can either exist or I should be able to simply create a new one. 
I would really appreciate your help!

Thanks a lot!
